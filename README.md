##  About

A repository of homeworks from **The Hacking Project**—that peer-powered, straight-shooting code school that tosses you into projects instead of lectures. It's immersive, relentless, and real. Check them out at [The Hacking Project website](https://www.thehackingproject.org) for the full story.

##  Workspace

Here lives the homeworks' source code. The results are stored in my personal website: [mourre.net](https://www.mourre.net). Visit it if you're curious or a relentless critic / troll.
